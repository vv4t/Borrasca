# BORRASCA

Borrasca is a top-down adventure game for my school multimedia game design
project. The game is a top-down adventure game of a miner battling his way
through a cave of monsters who are vulnerable to light.

The game was written in C++ is attempts to replicate the graphics of Realm of
the Mad God to a moderate degree of success.

However, because of time restrictions, the game was not finished.
